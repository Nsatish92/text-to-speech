# text-to-speech
we create an HTML file that includes a textarea where the user can input the text to be spoken, a button to trigger the text-to-speech conversion, an audio element to play the spoken text, and a script tag that links to the JavaScript file.

The CSS file provides some basic styling for the elements.

The JavaScript file sets up the text-to-speech functionality using the Web Speech API. It creates a new instance of the SpeechSynthesisUtterance class and sets the language and voice of the speech. It also adds an event listener to the speak button that sets the text of the speech to the text input, speaks the text using the speak method of the speechSynthesis object,
